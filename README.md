# DOTA2_NLP
Problem Statement:

In the highly strategic and competitive landscape of Dota 2, effective itemization plays a crucial role in determining the outcome of matches. Each hero's success is not only dependent on its innate abilities but also on the items it acquires throughout the game. With a vast pool of heroes, each possessing unique skills, and the dynamic nature of matches, players often face challenges in choosing the right items to counter their opponents.

Objective:

The objective of this project is to develop an NLP-based recommendation system that assists Dota 2 players in making informed decisions about item builds. The system should take into account the hero the user is playing and the opponents' heroes to provide tailored suggestions for itemization that maximize effectiveness and counter the opposing team.

Key Features:

  Input Parameters:
    User's selected hero.
    Opponent heroes.

  Data Sources:
    Dota 2 API for real-time hero and item statistics.

  Natural Language Understanding:
    Develop an NLP model capable of understanding user inputs in natural language, extracting relevant information about the chosen hero and opponent heroes.
